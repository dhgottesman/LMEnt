The [[Adjarians|Adjarians]] (tr), also known as [[Adjarians|Muslim Georgians]], are an [[ethnographic group]] of [[Georgians]] indigenous to [[Adjara]] in south-western [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Adjarian settlements are also found in the Georgian provinces of [[Guria]], [[Kvemo Kartli]], and [[Kakheti]], as well as in several areas of neighboring [[Turkey]].

Adjarians converted to [[Islam]] during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]] of Adjara. Under the 1921 [[Treaty of Kars]], Adjara was granted autonomy, to protect its Muslim faith. Despite their conversion to Islam, Adjarians have kept the [[Georgian language]] (with [[Adjaran dialect|their own dialect]]) and [[Culture of Georgia (country)|traditions]]. Still, their [[Self-concept|self-identification]] is ambiguous as their Islamic background is at odds with the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Orthodox faith]] of their Georgian peers. In the 1926 census, Adjarians were categorized as a distinct ethnic group. In the 1939 census, they were included in the same category as Georgians. Since [[1991 Georgian independence referendum|Georgian independence]], most Adjarians consider themselves Georgians, but some Georgians have seen Muslim Adjarians as [[Second-class citizen|second-class]] "[[Turkification|Turkicized]]" Georgians.

==History ==

Adjarians, like other sub-ethnical groups of Georgians, have historically followed Christianity. Although the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman millet system]] allowed its subjects extensive [[self-governance]] and [[religious freedom]], many Adjarians chose to convert to [[Islam]] during the 200 years of Ottoman presence in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Nobility of Georgia (country)|nobility]] converted first. Adjarians were fully Islamized by the end of the eighteenth century.

During the 1853–1856 [[Crimean War]] and the 1877–1878 [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], many Adjarians fought on the side of the Turks. The Ottomans were forced to cede Adjara to the expanding [[Russian Empire]] in 1878 under the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. Russian authorities initially promoted emigration and many [[Muhacir|Adjarians moved to the Ottoman Empire]]. However, Russian authorities then tried to win the loyalty of Adjarians by building mosques and madrassas. As a result, many [[muhacir]] came back to Adjara.

Adjara became part of the independent [[Georgian Democratic Republic]] in 1918. However, in April 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded Georgia and captured Batumi. On 4 June 1918, the [[Treaty of Batum]] was signed, under which Georgia was forced to cede Adjara to the Ottoman Empire. However, due to the Ottoman defeat in the First World War and the [[Treaty of Mudros]], the Ottomans soon withdrew from the territory, and Adjara fell under the temporary occupation of Great Britain. During this time, under the leadership of prominent Adjarian activist [[Memed Abashidze]], the Congress of the Representatives of Muslim Georgians was held on 31 August 1919. It passed a resolution supporting reunification with Georgia and elected Majlis of Georgian Muslims, which represented Muslim Georgians in relation to the British administration.

The British administration ceded Adjara to the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] on July 20, 1920. It was granted autonomy under the Georgian constitution adopted in February 1921 when the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Red Army invaded Georgia]]. Achara joined the territory of [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Georgia]] under the 1921 [[Treaty of Kars]], between the Ottoman Empire and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. The treaty required that Achara would have "administrative autonomy and the right to develop its own culture, its own religion, and its own agrarian regime". However, the [[Soviet anti-religious legislation|Soviet atheist ideology]] dampened religious practice in the region, thus diminishing the Adjarian legitimation for autonomy within the Soviet system. In the 1920s, the Achars rebelled against the Soviet anti-Islamic activities and [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization reforms]]. The armed uprising began in the mountainous regions of Adjara in April 1929. Soviet troops were deployed in response and swiftly quelled the revolt.

The Georgian population of Adjara had been generally known as [[Islam in Georgia (country)|Muslim Georgians]] until the 1926 Soviet [[census]] listed them as "Adjarians", separate from the rest of Georgians, counting 71,426 of them. In subsequent censuses (1939–1989), they were listed with other Georgians, as no official Soviet census asked about religion.

There was a resurgence of the Adjarian religious identity during the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the USSR]]. Islamic religious practice became the cultural norm, [[madrassas]] reopened and the [[call to prayer]] sounded from mosques. Local leader [[Aslan Abashidze]] leveraged the ongoing [[Islamic revival]] to advance his political goals. After the Georgian independence, the first Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia appointed Abashidze as the chairman of Ajaria's parliament in 1991. Taking advantage of the turmoil caused by the [[Georgian Civil War]], [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia war (1991–1992)|South Ossetia]], he unilaterally took power without formal agreement and started to withhold tax revenue and capture [[Economy of Adjara|Adjara's considerable wealth]]. The Head [[Mufti]] of Achara, Haji Mahmud Kamashidze, supported Abashidze in his power struggle. However, after Abashidze reached his goals, he stopped using the Muslim movement for his political goals. The [[2004 Adjara crisis]] led to Aslan Abashidze stepping down from his post after thousands of Adjarians protested against his rule in Batumi in May 2004, with Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] symbolically proclaiming "Abashidze has fled, Adjara is free".

Ajarians, like [[Ossetians]] and [[Abkhazians]], benefit from a special regime to claim [[Russian citizenship law|Russian citizenship]] with an expedited application process, perceived as Russian interference by Georgia.

== Religion ==
In the sixteenth century, the majority of Adjara's population was Christian. By the end of the eighteenth century, all Adjarians were Muslim. After Adjara was ceded to the Russian Empire in 1878 under the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], Adjarians, who were Muslims, were allowed to leave for Turkey. This was followed by an influx of Christians from [[Kakheti]], resulting in a change of the religious landscape.

While the Russian authorities supported the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]'s missionary efforts, they also tried to win the loyalty of Adjarians by building mosques and madrassas and supporting the local Muslim clergy. As a result, some Adjarians emigrants, called [[Muhacir]], came back to Adjara.

The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] and [[1991 Georgian independence referendum|Georgian independence]] first led to an [[Islamic revival]]. Christianization of some Adjarians also took place, especially among the young, under the government of Zviad Gamsakhurdia. However, most Adjarians, particularly around [[Khulo]], remain [[Sunni Muslim]]. According to [[Ghia Nodia]], as of 2006, many Adjarians are Muslims but consider themselves ethnic Georgians. 

According to the 2014 census, Muslims make up 94.6% of the population in [[Khulo Municipality]], 74.4% in [[Shuakhevi Municipality]], 62.1% in [[Keda Municipality]] and 56.3% in [[Khelvachauri Municipality]]. In [[Batumi]] and [[Kobuleti Municipality]] Muslims make up a minority with 25.4% and 28.8%.

== Language ==
Adjarians speak [[Adjaran dialect|Adjarian]], a [[Georgian dialects|Georgian dialect]] related to the one spoken in the neighboring northern province of [[Guria]], but with a number of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] [[loanword]]s. Adjarian also possesses many features in common with the [[Zan languages]] ([[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] and [[Laz language|Laz]]), which are [[sister language|sisters]] to Georgian and are included in the [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian language]] group.
