An [[Adjudicator|adjudicator]] is someone who presides, [[judge]]s, and [[arbitration|arbitrates]] during a formal [[:wikt:dispute|dispute]] or [[competition]]. They have numerous purposes, including preliminary [[legal judgment]]s, to determine applicant eligibility, or to assess contenders' performance in competitions.

== Types ==
=== Arbiters ===
An example is a person who makes a preliminary [[Legal judgment|judgment]] as to an [[unemployment insurance]] claim. An adjudicator makes an initial decision to keep a case from going to court. Although the adjudicator's decision does not have legal weight, the adjudicator has rendered a decision. Although a case can be appealed to a judge, the adjudicator's decision is frequently accepted as the same as what a judge would make, keeping many time-consuming cases out of the court system.

=== Decision-making panels ===
The term is used to refer to a panel of judges in the process of considering [[security clearance]]s for the United States government. The panel reviews information from a [[background investigation]] and a [[polygraph]] and decides whether to grant the clearance. Adjudicators can be a medical review board that makes [[disability]] and retirement benefit decisions for Federal employees and military personnel. Adjudicators also exist for immigration benefits.

=== Official evaluations ===
An adjudicator (often referred to as a "judge", "umpire", "arbiter", or more archaically as a "daysman"), is a person who gives a critical evaluation of performances in [[Music competition|competitions]], festivals or [[talent show]]s, resulting in the award of marks, medals or prizes.

In [[British Parliamentary Style|BP debate]], an adjudicator weighs arguments and decides rankings in the house. There are different types of adjudicators, each with their respective duties and levels of authority: chair, panelist, and trainee. In the event that the chair is the chief adjudicator of the tournament, they are referred to as "Speaker".
